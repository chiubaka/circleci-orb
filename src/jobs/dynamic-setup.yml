  Setup job for dynamic configuration. Does some basic setup of the repository
  and then generates config from a set of expected templates for continuation.
  Client projects must include a `.circleci/react-native.template.yml` file and a
  `.circleci/js.template.yml` file. A main.yml file will be generated for continuation
  using one of these files using the `envsubst` command.

  React Native templates will be supplied with the following variables:
  - $IOS_SEMVER_REGEX: a regular expression that matches tags for all iOS-enabled projects
  - $ANDROID_SEMVER_REGEX: a regular expression that matches tags for all Android-enabled projects
  - $SETUP_IOS_APPS_STEPS: a list of automatically generated steps for initializing all iOS-enabled
      projects. This is meant to be used as part of an alias in the `constants` block. See the
      react-native example for details.
  - $SETUP_ANDROID_APPS_STEPS: a list of automatically generated steps for initializing all Android-enabled
      projects. This is meant to be used as part of an alias in the `constants` block. See the
      react-native example for details.
